# Subagent Driven Development

This skill helps you orchestrate multiple sub-agents to complete complex tasks.

## Instructions

1. Decompose the main task into independent sub-tasks.
2. Assign each sub-task to a specialized sub-agent (or a new agent instance).
3. Monitor the progress of each sub-agent and coordinate their outputs.
4. Integrate the results to complete the main task.
