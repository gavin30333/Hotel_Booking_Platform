# Systematic Debugging

This skill guides you through a systematic process to identify and fix bugs.

## Instructions

1. Reproduce the issue and confirm the expected behavior.
2. Isolate the problem by narrowing down the scope (e.g., specific component, function, or API).
3. Analyze the code and logs to understand the root cause.
4. Formulate a hypothesis and test it.
5. Implement the fix and verify it with tests.
